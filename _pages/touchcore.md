TouchCORE is a multitouch-enabled tool for agile model-driven software development aimed at developing scalable and reusable software models. Currently, the tool gives the modeller access to a library of reusable models encoding essential recurring design concerns (security, fault tolerance, distribution, design patterns). It exploits model interfaces and aspect-oriented model weaving techniques to enable the designer to rapidly apply reusable design concerns.

The most recent stable release of TouchCORE supports feature models, goal models, class diagrams, sequence diagrams and state diagrams, as well as importing of Java classes from jar files and Java code generation.

* Last stable release: [TouchCORE v7.0.3](/files/TouchCORE_v7_stable.zip)
