Since 2002 I am a professor at the [School of Computer Science](http:www.cs.mcgill.ca/) of [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca), Montreal, Canada, where I head the Software Composition and Reuse (SCORE) lab. I hold an engineering diploma and a Ph.D. from the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology](https://www.epfl.ch/) (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland. I also was/am a visiting professor at the [University of Luxemburg](https://wwwen.uni.lu), at [IRISA Rennes](http://www.irisa.fr/en), the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu), the [Université Côte d'Azur](https://univ-cotedazur.eu), and the [University of Malaga](https://www.uma.es/).

My main area of research is software engineering, and in particular model-driven engineering. I have for the last decade concentrated on investigating paradigms, language features and technologies that allow software engineers to build reusable software artefacts. At the programming and modelling language level I am therefore interested in modularity (interfaces, visibility), separation of concerns, composition techniques (e.g., aspect-orientation), and exceptions. I have also done work in fault tolerance and distributed systems, in particular software fault tolerance, transaction support, and massively multiplayer games. You can check out my research pages for more details on current and past projects related to these topics.
