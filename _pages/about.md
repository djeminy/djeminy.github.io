Since July 2023 I am a contracted researcher at [ITIS Software](https://itis.uma.es/) at the [University of Malaga](https://www.uma.es/). From 2002 to August 2024 I was a professor at the [School of Computer Science](http:www.cs.mcgill.ca/) of [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca), Montreal, Canada, where I headed the Software Composition and Reuse (SCORE) lab. I hold an engineering diploma and a Ph.D. from the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology](https://www.epfl.ch/) (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland. I also was/am a visiting professor at the [University of Luxemburg](https://wwwen.uni.lu), at [IRISA Rennes](http://www.irisa.fr/en), the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu), the [Université Côte d'Azur](https://univ-cotedazur.eu), and the [University of Malaga](https://www.uma.es/).

My main area of research is software engineering, and in particular model-driven engineering. I have for the last decade concentrated on investigating paradigms, language features and technologies that allow software engineers to build reusable software artefacts. At the programming and modelling language level I am therefore interested in modularity (interfaces, visibility), separation of concerns, composition techniques (e.g., aspect-orientation), and exceptions. I have also done work in fault tolerance and distributed systems, in particular software fault tolerance, transaction support, and massively multiplayer games. You can check out my [research pages](/portfolio/) for more details on current and past projects related to these topics.
