### Short Biography

Jörg Kienzle is a full professor at the School of Computer Science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, where he is leading the Software Composition and Reuse Laboratory (SCORE). He holds a Ph.D. and engineering diploma from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). His current research interests include model-driven engineering, concern-oriented software development, reuse, software development methods in general, aspect-orientation, distributed systems and fault tolerance. He has co-organized and organized many workshops (16 workshops on Aspect-Oriented Modelling, 14 1-week workshops on Modelling at the Bellairs Research Institute, 4 workshops on exception handling, 3 workshops on comparing modelling approaches), and is actively involved in the MODELS / ECMFA and Modularity:AOSD:<Programming> communities (PC member, workshop chair, PC chair of Modularity:AOSD 2013, PC chair of MODELS 2016).
