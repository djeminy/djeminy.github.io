Concern-oriented Reuse (CORE) is an new software development paradigm introduced by my research team in 2013 that combines the ideas of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), advanced modularization techniques (aspects), and software product lines, to address the challenge of how to enable broad-scale, model-based reuse. A concern is a unit of reuse that groups together software artifacts (models and code,) describing properties and behaviour related to any domain of interest to a software engineer at different levels of abstraction. A concern provides three interfacesÂ [#kienzle2016b]: The variation interface (VI) describes required design decisions and their impact on high-level system qualities, both explicitly expressed using feature and impact models in the concern specification. The customization interface (CI) allows the chosen variation to be adapted to a specific reuse context, while the usage interface (UI) defines how the functionality encapsulated by a concern may be used. CORE streamlines the reuse process by allowing a developer to a) choose a desired variant (from the VI), adapt the chosen models to the reuse context (with the CI), and then CORE offers the developer the possibility delay design decisions.
